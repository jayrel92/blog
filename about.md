Over the past 10 years I have been involved with Technology in some for or another from break-fix to deployment.  This portfolio is a place where I can record projects and display my achievements.

This portfolio will contain any homelab projects I have completed, relevant info on how to configure hardware, applications and services, updates on new homelab tech deployed and maybe the occasional blog post on current projects Iâ€™m undertaking.

I'm an Senior IT Operations Technician for Fanduel based in the NJ. I have a huge interested in all forms of technology which I get to fulfil both at work and at home.

In my various roles over the year I have been involved in Consultancy, implementation and support, primarily working with VMware, Cisco, IBM, Dell, HPE, and Microsoft, although previous endeavors have allowed me to cross paths with PBX's Avaya, Cisco and Nortel.
