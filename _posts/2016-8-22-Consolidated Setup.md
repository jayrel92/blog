Here you can see that I did a bit more organizing of the rack. To accommodate adding a monitor and keyboard as my KVM console is moved my wifiAP to a more central location on the wall in my room. Added a 1U brush panel to clean it up a little bit but the 1" flat cables looked like spaghetti.

I kept this setup for a few months learning the basics of VMWare vSphere on the Dell servers.
