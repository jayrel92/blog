Since 2017 I have been interested in servers and networking, and started running them at home. Here is a history of changes over the years

I don't have full explanations of everything, but ill try to mention things as I go.

You will have to excuse the poor image quality of some of these!

2018

This is the only picture I have from 2018 of the first setup, this was a Dell R610, sitting on top of a few boxes and a container. I had an R320 sitting on the floor because two servers were too heavy for the boxes. On top I had an Edge Router Lite sending VLANs to the Unifi Switch PoE 8. DNS was handled by a raspberry pi 3B+ running piHole and a basic Netgear R7000 Nighthawk destributing wifi throughout.
