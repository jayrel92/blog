At this stage I was pretty tired of Unifi/Edge appliances and wanted to take the more Enterprise route with routing and switching. I tore down the rack and sold pretty much everything and started a new.

I picked up a Watchguard XTM 515 off Ebay for quite cheap as the seller didn't really know what he was selling. I loaded pfSense on it, set up VLANs for my servers and services and a network for my roommates. It came with a 2 core Intel Celeron E3400 with 2GBs of RAM which wasn't sufficient to handle the 1Gb of traffic me and my roommates would saturate daily. Had to upgrade to a Intel Core2Quad Q9505 and 4GBs of RAM so that it could run quieter. I painted the Watchguard chassis black because the original red didn't fit the aesthetic of the rack.

Quickly got rid of the 1" flat CAT6 cables with 0.5" and 1" Monoprice Slim Run cables.
