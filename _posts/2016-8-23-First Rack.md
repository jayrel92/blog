I lucked out and found a Startech 12u 4 post rack on r/homelabsales for $100. This would let me use real rails to mount my full depth servers, and clean up a lot of the cable management. At this point I added a UPS to keep the network and wifi AP up during storms.

To accommodate for hardware I plan on using I upgraded to a 24-port Unifi Switch. I also ended up getting a 1u rackmount for my EdgeRouter. Next I purchased a Supermicro 502 Atom D525 to run as intro into FreeBSD routing, testing OpenSense and pfSense. Finally ditched the Node 202 as a media PC to run OpenMediaVault/Plex (OMV) on a Rock64 4GB SBC. Linked to a TerraMaster DAS with 2x 3TB WD Red drives in Raid0 and 3x 2TB Toshiba drives in Raidz1 as backup. It instead served as an Assetto Corsa Dedicated Server hosting up to 32 concurrent drivers and cars for a 24/7 period. The Raspberry Pi still doing its thing running piHole.
