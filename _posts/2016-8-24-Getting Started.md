I decided it needed to be cleaned up, added a media PC, and a few other bits. The Fractal Design Node 202 ran Windows Server 2012 + OpenMediaVault Drivepool, then I added a 8-port Dell PowerConnect as management switch for my ESXi hosts on the R320 and R610. This was my first introduction into hypervisors and hosting services in Docker Container VM's. I did not have a UPS, which was fun when the power went out.

I put it on a series Ikea shelves in my closet. I guess my cable management was okay for the time. Not much to work with since the Ikea shelves are open. The bottom shelf contained cisco gear that my company decommissioned allowing me to learn Cisco IOS commands for basic network configuration.
